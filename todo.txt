backlog:
- useUser is causing weird behavior
- why are there so many rerenders inside room? could be websocket connecting
- when a user creates a game, then joins the game, then refreshes if there's nothing else going on in the game no state will be sent back to the frontend


- create component for adding chips
- create reusable compoent for when pages are loading

- should we sent "myPlayer" from backend? that way frontend will automatically know which seat is theirs, and we can control players cards this way
- fix min bet
